# CSCI115TermProjectFall2020
Comparison of Sorting Algorithms
12/01/2020

Source.cpp contains the main() function, which acts as a driver to access all eight sorting algorithms.  Sorting algorithms are separated into respective header files and must be present during compilation.

It is suggested to clone this project's github repository into a Visual Studio environment, and compile and run from there. https://github.com/nugentmichael1/CSCI115TermProjectFall2020

Once the program starts a series of menus are presented to access each individual sort, choose a particular case, and define an input size.  Be warned that large input sizes with slow algorithms can take upwards of 20 minutes to process.
